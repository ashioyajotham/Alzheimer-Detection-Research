### About
This application uses deep learning to analyze brain MRI scans and detect different stages of Alzheimer's Disease. 
The model has been trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans and can classify them into four categories:
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented

    1. Upload a brain MRI scan image
    2. Wait for the analysis
    3. View the results and probability distribution
    
    For best results:
    - Use clear, high-quality MRI scans
    - Images should be properly oriented
    - Ensure the scan shows the full brain structure
